## 1.8.0

### Minor Changes

- ca43061: Adds new way of distributing discounts on items (proportional). Adds distinguishment between when TaxJar nexus was found and was not. Now, the "not found" behavior is not treated as error, and will return untaxed values. Fixes bugs: item quantity in TaxJar; when shipping = 0; pricesEnteredWithTax influences shipping price.

- Updated dependencies [6e69f4f]
  - @saleor/apps-shared@1.6.1

## 1.7.0

### Minor Changes

- 23b5c70: Set minimum Saleor version where app can be installed (3.9).

  Previously, app could have been installed in any Saleor, but if required taxes APIs were missing, app would crash

  Now, Saleor will reject installation if possible. If Saleor can't do it, App will check Saleor version during installation and fail it if version doesn't match

- dd799e6: Adds `resolveOptionalOrThrow` util that throws when not able to resolve an optional value. Now, when critical values from external APIs are not found, the app will crash instead of falling back to 0s.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [23b5c70]
  - @saleor/apps-shared@1.6.0

## 1.6.1

### Patch Changes

- c406318: Updated dep @saleor/app-sdk to 0.38.0
- 51134a5: Fix returning 0 for line price if Avatax returns isItemTaxable: false. This happens in, f.e., certain states in the US where there is no sales tax. After the fix, the app will fall back to the original line price.

### Minor Changes

- 72adeb3: Changed behavior of failed webhooks. The app will now return status 500 if the operation failed. Previously, it returned status 200 with an error message in the response body.

### Patch Changes

- 70bf546: Fix the calculations of shipping price and line prices based on the `pricesEnteredWithTax` value. Before, the Tax App didn't consider the `pricesEnteredWithTax` setting. Now, it will return different values for `pricesEnteredWithTax` true/false.
